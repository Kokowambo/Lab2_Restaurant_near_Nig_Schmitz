# Lab2_Restaurant_near_Nig_Schmitz

This Repository was created for the Lab Session 2 in the University Course Open GIS and Open Data in Geoinformation (2025S). 
This Repo includes a Map about Restaurants that are within a 600m radius around the Center of Vienna in the first District. Some filters where added to include only restaurants that are open Mondays from 19:00.
